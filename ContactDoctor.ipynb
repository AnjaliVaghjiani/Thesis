        "    a) Reach 150 Zone Minutes: You're close to the recommended 150 Zone Minutes. Consider extending the duration or intensity of one of your gym sessions, or adding a short, brisk walk on a rest day.\n",
        "    b) Periodization: If you're looking to challenge yourself, consider introducing periodization into your gym routine, varying the intensity and type of workouts to prevent plateaus.\n",
        "    c) Flexibility and Mobility: Ensure you're dedicating enough time to stretching, foam rolling, or mobility work, especially with regular hiking and gym sessions, to prevent injury and improve range of motion.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Sleep and Social:\n",
        "    7 hours of sleep is good, but optimizing for 7.5-8 hours could offer further benefits for recovery and performance.\n",
        "    a) Consistent Sleep Schedule: Fine-tune your sleep schedule to ensure consistency, even after weekend hikes, to maintain your circadian rhythm.\n",
        "    b) Evening Routine: Prioritize a relaxing evening routine to help your body and mind wind down after active days.\n",
